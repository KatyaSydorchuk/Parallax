They are located in the southwestern corner of Western Ukraine, within administrative territories of four Ukrainian regions (oblasts), covering northeastern part of Zakarpattia Oblast, southwestern part of Lviv Oblast, southern half of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and western half of Chernivtsi Oblast.</p>

                        They are stretching in general northwest–southeast direction, starting at the tripartite border point of Ukraine with Poland and Slovakia, and continuing towards Ukrainian border with Romania. In terms of geological classification, Ukrainian Carpathians belong to two distinctive categories, with major part belonging to the Outer Eastern Carpathians and minor part to the Inner Eastern Carpathians. </p>

                        <p class="_anim-show"> Within different regional and national traditions, there are several overlapping variants of divisions and designations for various Eastern Carpathian mountain ranges. Within the wider scope of the Ukrainian Carpathians, a section of the Outer Eastern Carpathians spaning southeastern corner of Poland, northeastern corner of Slovakia and western part of Ukraine is commonly known as the Eastern Beskids (Ukrainian: Східні Бескиди; Polish: Beskidy Wschodnie), while in Slovakia the term Meadowed Mountains (Slovak: Poloniny) is also used for the same mountain range. The scope of those terms varies in accordance to different traditions and classifications. </p>

                            <li>The Palanok Castle or Munkács" Castle (Ukrainian: Замок "Паланок", romanized: Zamok "Palanok"; Hungarian: Munkács vára, Munkácsi vár, German: Plankenburg) is a historic castle in the city of Mukacheve in the western Ukrainian oblast (province) of Zakarpattia. The Palanok Castle is delicately preserved,[1] and is located on a former 68 metre high volcanic hill. The castle complex consists of three parts: the high, middle, and low castle.</li>
                            <li>Lake Synevyr (Ukrainian: озеро Синевир) is the largest lake in the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine. It is located in Mizhhiria Raion, Zakarpattia Oblast, not far from the village of Synevyr Poliana. It is part of the National natural preserve "Synevyr", which was established in 1989. Scientists estimate that the lake formed about ten thousand years ago. In 2008, the lake was recognized as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine.</li>
                            <li>The Schönborn Palace (Czech: Schönbornský palác) in the Malá Strana district of Prague is the current home of the United States Embassy to the Czech Republic. The first United States Minister to Czechoslovakia was Richard Crane, the grandson of a Chicago plumbing millionaire. Crane, who had acquired the palace at the end of the First World War, sold the building in 1925 to the United States Government for $117,000.</li>
                            <li>Pretty underwhelming waterfall, packed with tourists and kids. Very cold water, if you want to paddle in more peaceful surroundings, hike around ten-twenty minutes upstream for a better location.
                            Some huts selling food and drinks, with some local souvenirs and delicacies such as honey and mushrooms.</li>
